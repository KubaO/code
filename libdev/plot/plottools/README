The _Plot Tools_ Library (based on Qwt)
---------------------------------------

      The _Plot Tools_ Library is an extension to Qwt Plots.
	  Qwt is an extension to the libraries of the Qt Project.  	  
	  
	  It allows the simplified creation of line and matrix plots
	  using overloaded class definitions and included functionality.
	  These classes support right away:
	  - line plots
	  - zooming, even with 2 Y axis
	  - grids
	  - [new] color palettes for nice line colors
	  - matrix pseudo color plots (Spectrogram)
	  - [new] color maps like (jet, gray)


      Plot Tools is hosted at https://github.com/pospiech/code/tree/master/libdev/plot/plottools
	  Qwt is hosted at http://qwt.sf.net
	  

Installation
------------
      
	  The library contains only header files and requires no installation.
	  Add the plot tools path to your C++ project and use the classes.
