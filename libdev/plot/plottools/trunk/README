The _Plot Tools_ Library (based on Qwt)
---------------------------------------

      Qwt is an extension to the libraries of the Qt Project.  
	  The _Plot Tools_ Library is and additional extension to Qwt Plots.
	  
	  It allows the simplified creation of line and matrix plots
	  using overloaded class defintions and included functionality.
	  These classes support right away:
	  - line plots
	  - zooming, even with 2 Y axis
	  - grids
	  - [new] color palettes for nice line colors
	  - matrix pseudo color plots (Spectrogram)
	  - [new] color maps like (jet, gray)
